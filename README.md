Simple Trainstation2 resource calculator

TODOS:
  - add another recipe
  - simplify onload function
  - refactor
  - add a recipe that is dependent on a previous recipe
  - refactor
  - add more recipes
  - hopefully drive out a pattern that scales but is also easily consumable

MAYBES/THOUGHTS:
  - select multiple recipes to calculate from
    shopping list output?
      could help centralize the necessary ingredients
  - create inventory separate from the recipe calculations
    inventory could simplify the retrieval of available ingredients
    would most likely also clean up the UI
      ie recipes like pallet (timber -> logs, nails -> steel) could become quite bloated
    do enough complex recipes exist to justify this desire or suggestion?
    is it a pain point to have to deal with?
    could this help with multiple recipe selection?
  - include trains and or payload sizes for time calculations
  - vue
  - typescript
  - probably shouldn't use vue and typescript together
